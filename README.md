# user_auth_MongoDB
A playground environment to practice different technologies and its various use cases.

# Introduction
After participating at PatriotHacks 2021, I was inspired to delve further into Flask. This application is a very simple user authentication. 

# Built With
Flask, MongoDB

# Prerequisites
Python 2.6 or higher is usually required for installation of Flask. Although Flask and its dependencies work well with Python 3 (Python 3.3 onwards), many Flask extensions do not support it properly. Hence, it is recommended that Flask should be installed on Python 2.7. 

# Installation

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/a-zuniga/user_auth_MongoDB.git
   ```
2. Access the repo
   ```sh
   cd user_auth_MongoDB
   ```
3. Install PIP dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run program on local host
